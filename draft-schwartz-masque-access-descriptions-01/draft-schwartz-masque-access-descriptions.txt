   This specification provides a format for identifying a collection of
   such services.

1.  Introduction

   In HTTP/1.1, forward proxy service was originally defined in two
   ways: absolute-uri request form (encrypted at most hop-by-hop), and
   HTTP CONNECT (potentially encrypted end-to-end).  Both of these
   services were effectively origin-scoped: the access service was a
   property of the origin, not associated with any particular path.

   Recently, a variety of new standardized proxy-like services have
   emerged for HTTP.  These new services are defined by a URI template
   or path, allowing distinct instances of the same service type to be
   served by a single origin.  These services include:

   *  DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484]

   *  CONNECT-UDP [I-D.draft-ietf-masque-connect-udp]

   *  CONNECT-IP [I-D.draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip]

   *  Oblivious HTTP [I-D.draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp]

   This specification provides a unified format for describing a
   collection of such access services, and a mechanism for reaching such
   services when the initial information contains only an HTTP origin.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format

   An access service collection is defined by a JSON dictionary
   containing keys specified in the corresponding registry (Section 6).
   Inclusion of each key is OPTIONAL.  The corresponding media type is
   application/access-services+json.

   The "dns", "udp", and "ip" keys are each defined to hold a JSON
   dictionary containing the key "template" with a value that is a URI
   template suitable for configuring DNS over HTTPS, CONNECT-UDP, or
   CONNECT-IP, respectively.

   The "ohttp" key contains a dictionary with either or both of these
   keys:

   *  "proxy", containing a dictionary with a "template" key indicating
      the Oblivious Proxy's resource mapping.  The template MUST contain
      a "request_uri" variable indicating the Oblivious Request
      Resource.

   *  "request", containing a dictionary with a "uri" key indicating the
      Oblivious Request Resource and a "key" key conveying its KeyConfig
      in base64.

   If the Access Description is for a general-purpose proxy, all
   Oblivious Request Resources and Targets (respectively) are presumed
   to be supported; otherwise the supported Resources and Targets must
   be understood from context (but see Section 4).

3.1.  Examples

   {
     "dns": {
       "template": "https://doh.example.com/dns-query{?dns}",
     },
     "udp": {
       "template":
           "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target_host,target_port}"
     },
     "ip": {
       "template": "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target,ip_proto}"
     },
     "ohttp": {
       "proxy": {
         "template": "https://proxy.example.org/ohttp{?request_uri}"
       }
     }
   }

     "dns": {
       "template": "https://doh.example.com/dns-query{?dns}",
     },
     "ohttp": {
       "request": {
         "uri": "https://example.com/ohttp/",
         "key": "(KeyConfig in Base64)"
       }
     }
   }

4.  Discovery from an Origin

   In cases where the HTTP access service is identified only by an
   origin (e.g. when configured as a Secure Web Proxy), operators can
   publish an associated access service collection at the path "/.well-
   known/access-services", with the Content-Type "application/access-
   services+json".

   When the "ohttp.request" URI appears in an Access Description at this
   location, all URIs on this origin (except the Oblivious Request URI)
   are presumed to be reachable as Oblivious Request Targets.

   Clients MAY fetch this Access Description and use the indicated
   services (in addition to any origin-scoped services) automatically.
   Clients SHOULD use the description only while it is fresh according
   to its HTTP cache lifetime, refreshing it as needed.

5.  Security Considerations

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to open a Specification Required registry entitled
   "HTTP Access Service Descriptors", with the following initial
   contents:

                        +=======+=================+
                        | Key   | Specification   |

                        | ohttp | (This document) |
                        +-------+-----------------+

                                  Table 1

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "Well-Known URIs"
   registry:

   +=================+==========+=========+=============+==============+
   | URI Suffix      |Change    |Reference| Status      | Related      |

   +-----------------+----------+---------+-------------+--------------+

                                  Table 2

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "application"
   sub-registry of the "Media Types" registry:

        +======================+======================+===========+
        | Name                 | Template             | Reference |
        +======================+======================+===========+
        | access-services+json | application/access-  | (This     |
        |                      | services+json        | document) |
        +----------------------+----------------------+-----------+
