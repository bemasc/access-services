Abstract

   HTTP proxies can operate several different kinds of access services.
   This specification provides a format for identifying a collection of
   such services.

1.  Introduction

   In HTTP/1.1, forward proxy service was originally defined in two
   ways: absolute-uri request form (encrypted at most hop-by-hop), and
   HTTP CONNECT (potentially encrypted end-to-end).  Both of these
   services were effectively origin-scoped: the access service was a
   property of the origin, not associated with any particular path.

   Recently, a variety of new standardized proxy-like services have
   emerged for HTTP.  These new services are defined by a URI template,
   allowing distinct instances of the same service type to be served by
   a single origin.  These services include:

   *  DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484]

   *  CONNECT-UDP [RFC9298]

   *  CONNECT-IP [I-D.draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip]

   *  Modern HTTP Proxies [I-D.draft-schwartz-modern-http-proxies]

   This specification provides a unified format for describing a
   collection of such access services, and a mechanism for reaching such
   services when the initial information contains only an HTTP origin.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format

   An access service collection is defined by a JSON dictionary
   containing keys specified in the corresponding registry (Section 7).
   Inclusion of each key is OPTIONAL.  The corresponding media type is
   application/access-services+json.

   The initially defined keys are "http", tcp", "dns", "udp", and "ip".
   Each of these keys holds a JSON dictionary containing the key
   "template" with a value that is a URI template suitable for
   configuring a Modern HTTP proxy, Modern TCP Transport Proxy, DNS over
   HTTPS, CONNECT-UDP, or CONNECT-IP, respectively.  (Future keys might
   hold other JSON types.)

   If the Access Description is for a general-purpose proxy, all proxy
   targets are presumed to be supported.  Otherwise, the supported
   targets must be understood from context.

   {
     "http": {
       "template": "https://proxy.example.org/http{?target_uri}"
     },
     "tcp": {
       "template":
           "https://proxy.example.org/tcp{?target_host,tcp_port}"
     },
     "dns": {
       "template": "https://doh.example.com/dns-query{?dns}",
     },
     "udp": {
       "template":
           "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target_host,target_port}"
     },
     "ip": {
       "template": "https://proxy.example.org/masque{?target,ip_proto}"
     }
   }

4.  Client Authentication

   General-purpose clients of this specification SHOULD also implement
   support for Popup Authentication
   [I-D.draft-schwartz-httpapi-popup-authentication] when fetching the
   Access Description.  If Popup Authentication produced any
   Authorization or Cookie headers for the Access Description, the
   client MUST also apply those headers to any HTTP requests made using
   the included templates (subject to proxy-specific modifications, see
   Section 4.3 of [I-D.draft-schwartz-httpapi-popup-authentication]).
   These headers are applied even if the Access Description and the
   included services are on different HTTP origins.

   This arrangement allows the use of Access Descriptions to describe
   access-controlled services, and avoids asking the user to
   authenticate separately with each service.

5.  Discovery from an Origin

   In cases where the HTTP access service is identified only by an
   origin (e.g. when configured as a Secure Web Proxy), operators can
   publish an associated access service collection at the path "/.well-
   known/access-services", with the Content-Type "application/access-
   services+json".

   Clients MAY fetch this Access Description and use the indicated
   services (in addition to any origin-scoped services) automatically.
   Clients SHOULD use the description only while it is fresh according
   to its HTTP cache lifetime, refreshing it as needed.

6.  Security Considerations

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to open a Specification Required registry entitled
   "HTTP Access Service Descriptors", with the following initial
   contents:

                        +======+=================+
                        | Key  | Specification   |

                                 Table 1

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "Well-Known URIs"
   registry:

   +=================+==========+=========+=============+==============+
   | URI Suffix      |Change    |Reference| Status      | Related      |
   |                 |Controller|         |             | Information  |

   +-----------------+----------+---------+-------------+--------------+

                                  Table 2

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "application"
   sub-registry of the "Media Types" registry:

        +======================+======================+===========+
        | Name                 | Template             | Reference |
        +======================+======================+===========+
        | access-services+json | application/access-  | (This     |
        |                      | services+json        | document) |
        +----------------------+----------------------+-----------+

                                  Table 3
